- If something is not clear don’t hesitate to ask or just make an assumption and go with it
Criteria:
- Is the code functional:
  - Are there instructions to setup/install?
  - Does it meet the minimum requirements in the specification?
  - Does it return appropriate results in other circumstances?
- Is the code readable:
  - Sensible naming of variables and methods?
  - Sensible method sizes (<20 lines)?
